# Personal Website

A website created with React so that I can refresh my web development skills and as a way to pass the time while I apply for jobs post-graduation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

After checking out the repo, navigate to the project directory and run the command "npm start" in terminal.
This will start the web server and then you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the website.
